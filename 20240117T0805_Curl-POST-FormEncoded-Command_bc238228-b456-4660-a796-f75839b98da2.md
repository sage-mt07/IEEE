To use `curl` to send a POST request with form-encoded data, you can use a command like this:

```bash
curl -X POST -d "param1=value1&param2=value2" http://example.com/resource
```

Here's what each part does:
- `curl`: The basic command to use `curl`.
- `-X POST`: Specifies the request method, in this case, POST.
- `-d`: Indicates the data you want to send in the POST request.
- `"param1=value1&param2=value2"`: The actual data you're sending, formatted as `key=value` pairs, separated by `&`.
- `http://example.com/resource`: The URL where you're sending the request.
