To access your WordPress site's login page, append one of the following to your site's URL:

- `/login/`
- `/admin/`
- `/wp-login.php`

For example, if your site is `www.example.com`, you can access the login page at:

- `www.example.com/login/`
- `www.example.com/admin/`
- `www.example.com/wp-login.php`

If WordPress is installed in a subdirectory or subdomain, adjust the URL accordingly. For instance, if installed in a subdirectory named `wordpress`, the login URL would be:

- `www.example.com/wordpress/login/`
- `www.example.com/wordpress/wp-login.php`

It's important to note that the default login URLs are commonly known, which can pose security risks. To enhance your site's security, consider changing the default login URL to a custom one. This can be easily achieved using plugins like "WPS Hide Login," which allows you to set a unique login URL without modifying core files. citeturn0search0

By customizing your login URL, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access attempts and protect your site's integrity.
