Dynamic PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization) is a performance optimization technique used by compilers, including .NET’s JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler. Dynamic PGO aims to optimize the runtime performance of applications by gathering information about how the application is executed in real-world scenarios. This profile data is collected during the actual execution of the application and then used to improve the compilation of frequently executed code paths.

Here are the key features of Dynamic PGO:

1. **Runtime Collection of Profiling Data**: Unlike static PGO, which relies on profiling data gathered during a special training run, dynamic PGO collects data during normal application runs in production environments. The collected data is used to guide optimizations dynamically.

2. **Targeted Optimizations**: With dynamic PGO, the JIT compiler uses real-time execution information to better optimize "hot paths" (code that is frequently executed) and avoid over-optimizing rarely used code paths. This results in better overall performance.

3. **Adaptive**: Since dynamic PGO collects data during runtime, it can adapt to changing workloads and execution patterns, allowing the application to be optimized based on actual usage.

4. **Reduced Overhead**: By focusing on optimizing only the most frequently used code paths, dynamic PGO can reduce the overhead compared to static optimization methods that try to optimize everything.

5. **In .NET**: In .NET 6 and later, Dynamic PGO is integrated into the runtime to improve the performance of managed code. It enhances the JIT’s ability to make decisions such as inlining methods, choosing the best branch prediction, and tuning loops based on runtime behavior.

Overall, dynamic PGO is a powerful tool for achieving better runtime performance, particularly for applications where execution patterns may vary depending on the workload.
