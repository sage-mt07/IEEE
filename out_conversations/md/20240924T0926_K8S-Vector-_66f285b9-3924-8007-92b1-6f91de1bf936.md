The user is utilizing Vector in Kubernetes for log aggregation and is looking for parameters to address the issue where large log volumes cause internal bottlenecks.

To address internal bottlenecks when handling large log volumes in Vector, you can consider adjusting the following parameters:

1. **`buffer.max_bytes`**: This parameter controls the maximum size of the buffer before Vector starts applying backpressure. Increasing this value can help process more logs in-memory before they are written to disk.

2. **`rate_limit.num_items`**: You can set a rate limit to control the number of logs processed per second, helping to throttle the flow and avoid overwhelming Vector.

3. **`batch.max_bytes` / `batch.max_events`**: These parameters control the size of the batches of logs sent to the destination. Adjusting them can help balance between performance and throughput.

4. **`concurrency`**: You can increase the concurrency for sinks (e.g., Elasticsearch or S3) to process multiple batches of logs concurrently, reducing bottlenecks during transmission.

5. **`log_level`**: Adjusting the log level of Vector (e.g., setting it to `error` instead of `info`) can reduce the internal overhead of logging, freeing up more resources for actual log processing.

These parameters should help mitigate bottlenecks, but ensure that they are adjusted based on your specific Kubernetes environment and resource availability.
