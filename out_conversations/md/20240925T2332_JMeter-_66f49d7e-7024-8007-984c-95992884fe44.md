JMeter is showing a message indicating that it's trying to access `http://[127.0.0.1:5235]/api/Entra_idStaff` but cannot connect. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check if the server is running**: Ensure that the server you're trying to access on `127.0.0.1:5235` is up and listening on that port. You can use a browser or a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to check if the server is reachable.

2. **Firewall and Network Settings**: Ensure that no firewall or network settings are blocking JMeter from accessing the local server on `127.0.0.1`. If the server is hosted on a different machine, make sure that the IP is correct and the server is accessible.

3. **Correct JMeter HTTP Sampler**: Verify that the HTTP sampler in JMeter is correctly set up. It should be using the correct method (GET in this case), URL, and any required headers or query parameters.

4. **Check for Misconfigurations**: Double-check if there is a placeholder or incorrect configuration in the JMeter request URL. The URL should not include brackets around the IP (i.e., `127.0.0.1`, not `[127.0.0.1]`).

5. **Server Logs**: Check the server logs to see if it is receiving the request and if it logs any errors that might give more context.

6. **Port Availability**: Confirm that no other process is using the same port (5235) which might cause a conflict.

7. **JMeter Proxy Configuration**: If your environment requires proxy settings, ensure that JMeter is configured to use the correct proxy.

Try these steps and see if you can establish a connection to the server. Let me know if any specific error logs appear, and I can help further diagnose the issue.

127.0.0.1は変数に設定し、HTTPリクエストの画面で${SERVER}のように設定している

### assistant — 2024-09-25T23:33:42.986173+00:00

The user has set `127.0.0.1` as a variable in JMeter, and in the HTTP request screen, they are using `${SERVER}` for the server setting.

Given that you're using `${SERVER}` as a variable for `127.0.0.1` in the HTTP request, here are a few things to check:

1. **Verify Variable Initialization**: Ensure that the variable `SERVER` is initialized correctly. You can check this by adding a "User Defined Variables" element or through a configuration in your test plan. Make sure it looks something like this:

   ```bash
   SERVER = 127.0.0.1
   ```

2. **Debug Sampler**: To confirm that the `${SERVER}` variable is properly resolved, you can use a "Debug Sampler" in JMeter. This will display the value of all variables and properties in your test and help you verify that `SERVER` is resolving to `127.0.0.1`.

3. **Variable Scope**: Make sure the variable `${SERVER}` is defined in a scope where your HTTP request can access it. If it's defined in a lower scope (like within a specific thread group or test fragment), the HTTP request sampler may not recognize it.

4. **Double-check the HTTP Request Setup**: Ensure that in the HTTP request, `${SERVER}` is used only for the server IP/hostname, without the brackets, so it looks like this:
   
   - **Server Name or IP**: `${SERVER}`
   - **Port Number**: `5235`

   There should be no brackets in the URL format.

5. **Check Logs or Responses**: After running the test, check JMeter’s "View Results Tree" listener to confirm the actual request being sent, and see if the variable is resolved properly to `127.0.0.1`.

Try these steps, and let me know if the issue persists or if there are specific errors in the logs!
