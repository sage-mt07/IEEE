The issue you are encountering with gRPC after upgrading from .NET 6 to .NET 8, where the remote host is actively refusing the connection, could be due to several reasons. Here are some common troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Server Configuration**: Ensure that the gRPC server is correctly configured and running. Verify that it is listening on the correct port and address.

2. **Firewall and Network Settings**: Ensure that there are no firewall rules or network configurations blocking the connection to the gRPC server.

3. **SSL/TLS Configuration**: If your gRPC server is configured to use SSL/TLS, ensure that the client is also correctly configured to use SSL/TLS and that the certificates are valid and correctly set up.

4. **gRPC Service Registration**: Ensure that the gRPC services are correctly registered in the server’s startup configuration.

5. **Port Binding Issues**: Verify that the port on which the gRPC server is listening is not being used by another service. You can do this by running a command like `netstat -a -b` on Windows or `lsof -i :<port>` on Linux.

6. **Dependency Updates**: Ensure that all the dependencies related to gRPC are updated to their compatible versions with .NET 8.

7. **Check Logs**: Review the server and client logs for any specific error messages that could give more insight into why the connection is being refused.

8. **Check Service and Endpoint Definitions**: Ensure that the service definitions and endpoint configurations match between the client and the server.

Here's an example of how you might configure gRPC in an ASP.NET Core application:

**Server-side:**

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddGrpc();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }

        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapGrpcService<YourGrpcService>();
        });
    }
}
```

**Client-side:**

```csharp
var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://localhost:5001");
var client = new YourGrpcService.YourGrpcServiceClient(channel);

// Make gRPC calls using the client
```

If you have specific logs or error messages, please share them for more targeted troubleshooting.
