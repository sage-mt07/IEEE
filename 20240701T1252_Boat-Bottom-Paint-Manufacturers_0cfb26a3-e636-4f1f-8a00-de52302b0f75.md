Map 1. Tonnage loaded and discharged, 2021

(Billions of tons)  

Note: Europe includes the Russian Federation and the French overseas departments.

## Trends and geography of world seaborne trade

In 2021, international maritime trade bounced back by an estimated 3.2 per cent from 2020. Shipments reached 11.0 billion tons, a volume slightly below pre-pandemic levels.

Asia remained the world-leading maritime freight area with Asian ports, in both developed and developing regions, loading around 4.6 billion tons of goods, or about 42 per cent of total goods loaded in ports worldwide. About 7.1 billion tons, equivalent to 64 per cent of total goods discharged worldwide, were received by Asian ports in 2021.

In 1970, more than half of global seaborne trade was tanker cargo. In 2021, almost three-quarters of loaded goods were dry cargo, including bulk and cargo shipped in containers. Of the total maritime freight shipped internationally in 2021, 8.0 billion tons was dry cargo.【31†1】

Figure 1. Goods loaded worldwide

(Billions of tons)  

## Contribution of developing economies

Figure 2. Seaborne trade of developing economies

(Percentage of corresponding world tonnage)  

In 2021, developing economies still accounted for the majority of global seaborne trade. Asian developing economies alone discharged 50 per cent and loaded 35 per cent of the world total. Participation in globalized manufacturing and containerized trade has generally been concentrated in Asia, notably in China and neighbouring East Asian economies. Other developing regions did not contribute equally, a reflection of their varying degrees of integration into global value chains and manufacturing networks.

## Developments in seaborne trade balances

Developing economies reported a maritime trade deficit of 648 million tons in 2021 while developed economies had a maritime trade surplus. This is a reversal of roles from 2010 when the developing economies had a maritime trade surplus of similar magnitude.

The maritime trade deficit for developing economies can be attributed to discharging dry cargo including bulk and containerized goods more than loading. This in turn is concentrated in the developing economies of Asia. For other cargo types and in other geographical areas developing economies often have a maritime trade surplus.

This parallels the development in the composition of seaborne trade. There were 2.2 billion tons more goods traded by sea in 2021 than in 2011. Of that added volume, 92 per cent was dry cargo.

### Concepts and definitions

The figures on seaborne trade in this section measure the volumes of international shipments, in metric tons, of goods loaded and discharged in the world’s seaports. Cabotage and transshipments are not included.

Goods loaded for international shipment are assumed to be exports, while goods discharged from ships are assumed to be imports. The seaborne trade balance measures the difference between the volumes of loaded and discharged goods.

Dry cargo refers to cargo that is usually

年度別の海運トン数と距離についての情報は以下の通りです。

### 年度別海運トン数
世界の海上貿易量は年々増加しており、2021年には11億トンに達しました。この量は、パンデミック前の水準に近いものとなっています。アジアは海上貨物の主要な積出地域であり、全世界の積荷の約42％に相当する約4.6億トンの貨物がアジアの港で積み込まれました。同時に、全世界の64％にあたる7.1億トンの貨物がアジアの港で荷降ろしされました【23†source】【24†source】。

1970年には、世界の海上貿易の半分以上がタンカー貨物でしたが、2021年には積荷のほぼ3分の2がドライカーゴ（バルク貨物やコンテナ貨物）となっています【23†source】。

### 年度別海運距離
海上輸送の平均距離は、貨物の種類や輸送ルートによって異なりますが、近年のデータによると、平均輸送距離は増加傾向にあります。例えば、穀物やその他のドライバルク、コンテナ貨物、石油貨物の平均輸送距離は、1999年から2024年にかけて着実に伸びています【23†source】。

これらのデータは、国際海事機関（IMO）や国連貿易開発会議（UNCTAD）などの統計に基づいています。さらに詳細な情報や地域別のデータについては、UNCTADの「Review of Maritime Transport」レポートやStatistaの統計データが参考になります。
